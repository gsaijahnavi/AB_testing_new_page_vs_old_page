# Analysing AB testing results (New_page versus Old_page)

Within this project, I tried to understand whether the company should implement a new page or keep the old page using A/B test



### A/B test:
- In A/B test we set up our hypothesis to test if new page results in better conversion or not when compared to old page
- We will simulate our user groups with respect to conversions
- We will find the the p_value
- We will also use an alternative approach to validate / double check our results and decide whether to reject the null hypothesis
